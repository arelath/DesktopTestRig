# How to Build and Test

DesktopTestRig requires a Windows .NET SDK and the Visual Studio Desktop development with C++ build tools. Run commands from the repository root.

## Full build commands

The root build script exposes these targets:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 Restore
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 Compile
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 TestFast
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 CompileTestHarnesses
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 TestIntegration
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 TestCliE2E
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 TestFull
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 PublishCli --configuration Release
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 Pack --configuration Release
```

`Compile` builds both native injector architectures, managed projects, and repacked payloads. `TestFast` runs the client, payload, CLI, and MCP unit tests. `TestMcp` runs the MCP suite by itself. `TestIntegration` launches the desktop harness and exercises real-process attachment. `TestCliE2E` runs the packaged CLI against the real WPF and WinForms harnesses and writes command logs under `artifacts/cli-e2e-suites`. `TestFull` combines the declared fast and integration lanes; run the longer CLI E2E lane explicitly on an interactive Windows worker.

## Fast iteration

Use `fastbuild.ps1` and `fasttest.ps1` while changing one managed project:

```powershell
.\fastbuild.ps1 core
.\fasttest.ps1 core -Filter TargetActionCommandTests
.\fasttest.ps1 payload
.\fastbuild.ps1 cli
.\fasttest.ps1 cli
.\fastbuild.ps1 mcp
.\fasttest.ps1 mcp
```

The fast scripts do not replace `Compile` when an integration test needs newly repacked payload assemblies.

## Concurrent runs and timeouts

`build.ps1`, `fastbuild.ps1`, and `fasttest.ps1` serialize access to the checkout's shared `artifacts` and payload-staging trees. A second supported invocation waits for the first and reports its owner from `artifacts/.workspace-build-owner.json`; override the ten-minute acquisition limit with `-WorkspaceLockTimeout`, for example `-WorkspaceLockTimeout 00:02:00`. The operating system releases the lock automatically if an owner exits or crashes.

Raw `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` commands do not participate in this checkout lock. Do not overlap them with a supported build/test script unless their output and intermediate paths are genuinely isolated.

The root build bounds ordinary build processes at fifteen minutes and individual fast test projects at five minutes. Override these with `--process-timeout=hh:mm:ss`, `--test-timeout=hh:mm:ss`, or `--integration-timeout=hh:mm:ss`. Fast aggregate tests emit crash/hang diagnostics under `artifacts/test-results`; on an outer timeout, the build terminates only the child process tree it started.

## Test recordings

Integration tests produce semantic recordings by default. Pass `--no-test-recordings` to the root build, or `-NoTestRecordings` to `fasttest.ps1`, when recordings are intentionally disabled. The build maps this option to the NUnit run parameter `DesktopTestRigTestRecordings`.

## Packaging Workflow

Run `Compile`, `PublishCli`, and `Pack` from a clean checkout. `Pack` invokes standard SDK `dotnet pack` for `DesktopTestRig.csproj` and the optional `DesktopTestRig.Media.FFmpeg` project; NuGet derives dependency groups from the evaluated project references. Inspect `artifacts/staging`, `artifacts/publish`, and `artifacts/packages/<configuration>` before release. See `PayloadRepacking.md` for payload rules.

All managed projects use project-isolated outputs:

```text
artifacts/bin/<project>/<configuration>/<tfm>/
artifacts/obj/<project>/<configuration>/<tfm>/
artifacts/staging/payloads/<runtime-family>/
artifacts/packages/<configuration>/
```

The core package contains automation payloads and native injectors, but not FFmpeg. Install `DesktopTestRig.Media.FFmpeg` only for video recording, or configure `AppDriver.RecordingFfmpegPathOverride` with a separately managed executable.
