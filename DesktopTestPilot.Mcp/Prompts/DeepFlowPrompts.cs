		Declare an expectation when the resulting property is known; deepflow_act resolves, acts, verifies, and returns a condensed delta by default. If actions are denied, explain that the server must be started with allowActions.
		On ambiguity, choose one of the returned candidate handles or refine the semantic selector. Do not request first-match behavior unless order is intentional.

		For timing issues, use deepflow_wait with a bounded timeout; it supports disappearance, counts, property state, UI stability, responsiveness, and window-title changes.
